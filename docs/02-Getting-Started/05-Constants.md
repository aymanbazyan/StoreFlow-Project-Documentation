# Constants

---

Go to `./src/helpers/config.js` and edit whatever constant you need there.

For example:

```javascript
// Branding & Company Info
const BRAND_NAME = "Spring Hardware";

// Contact Information
const PHONE_NUMBER = "+920 519 489 323";
const DIRECT_SUPPORT_LINK = "https://wsend.co/9759514251";
const EMAIL = "rabeehardware@gmail.com";
const ADDRESS = "Spring Hardware, 123 Main St \n Nablus, Palestine";
const MAP_LINK = "https://maps.app.goo.gl/fFvqasd1TDsLUoQZ6";

/// .... others
```

:::tip
This file contains only the info that rarely changes, but most settings, such as the **theme, terms of service, descriptions, delivery polices, etc.**, can be changed in the [Admin Panel](/docs/Guides/Store-Management/How-to-open-the-Admin-Panel).
